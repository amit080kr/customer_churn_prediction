# Customer Churn Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting customer churn using the Telco Customer Churn dataset. Churn refers to customers who stop doing business with a company. Predicting churn helps businesses take proactive measures to retain customers, reducing costs associated with customer acquisition.

## Objective

The main goal is to develop a machine learning model to predict whether a customer will churn based on various features like demographic data, subscription details, and monthly charges.

## Achievements

- **Data Preprocessing:** Handled missing values, converted categorical variables into numeric format using Label Encoding, and scaled numerical features.

- **Class Imbalance Handling:** Utilized SMOTE to oversample the minority class, ensuring balanced training data.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualized correlations, churn distribution, and the impact of key features like MonthlyCharges on churn.

- **Model Training:** Built and tuned Random Forest and XGBoost classifiers to predict churn with high accuracy.

- **Evaluation:** Achieved robust performance metrics, visualized confusion matrices, and analyzed feature importance to interpret model predictions.

## Key Insights

Customers with higher MonthlyCharges are more likely to churn.
Contract type, online services, and tech support significantly impact churn behavior.

## Prediction Goal
The model predicts whether a customer is likely to churn, allowing businesses to take timely actions to improve customer retention.
